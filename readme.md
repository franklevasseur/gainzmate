# GainzMate

## Description

Gainzmate is Botpress bot for tracking my arm-wrestling progress. It was developed entirely as code without the need for Botpress Studio. The `dallox` package was developped to help with dialog focused logic like prompting for user input and validating it.

## Usage

```bash
pnpm i
cd packages/gainzmate
pnpm bp login
pnpm build
pnpm bp deploy
```
